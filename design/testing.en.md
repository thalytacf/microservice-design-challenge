# Testing Strategy

## 1. Objective

This section outlines the planned approach to testing the microservice, focusing on ensuring **reliability**, **data validation**, and **expected API behavior**. The strategy covers unit tests, future plans for integration and performance tests, and recommended tools for automation.

## 2. Types of Tests

### 1. Unit Tests

- Validate JSON input data (ex: required fields, correct types).
- Test isolated functions, such as database persistence and reading simulated data (mock).
- Verify expected errors for invalid inputs.

> **Suggested tools:** `pytest`, `unittest`, `fastapi.testclient`.  


### 2. Integration Tests (planned)

- Test the microservice end-to-end with a real database instance (ex: PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
- Ensure the endpoints work correctly with real data.


> **Future:** Use `docker-compose` to create test environments with dependencies.

### 3. Performance Tests (planned)

- Validate API response times, ensuring they meet the 500ms limit.
- Test the system with simulated large data volumes.

> **Suggested tools:** `Locust`, `Apache JMeter`, or scripts with `httpx`.

## 3. Expected Coverage

- All **critical functions** should be covered by tests.
- Complete validation of input data.
- Verify expected responses on main routes (`POST /data`, `GET /data`).

> Initial goal: **minimum 80% coverage on critical routes.**

## 4. Recommended Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `pytest` | Modern and simple testing framework for Python. |
| `fastapi.testclient` | HTTP client for testing APIs with FastAPI. |
| `coverage.py` | Tool for measuring test coverage. |

## 5. Future Improvements

- **Isolated environment:** Automated tests with a simulated database via Docker.
- **Monitoring:** Add continuous performance tests and alerts in production.

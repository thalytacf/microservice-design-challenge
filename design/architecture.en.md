# Microservice Architecture

## Overview

This microservice is designed with a focus on **simplicity, scalability, and maintainability**. It exposes two main routes (`POST /data` and `GET /data`) that handle high volumes of data through a well-defined layered architecture.

##  System Layers

### 1. API Layer
- Responsible for handling HTTP requests.
- Validates incoming JSON data.
- Returns standardized responses.
- Framework: **FastAPI**

### 2. Service Layer
- Contains business logic.
- Acts as a bridge between the API and the database.
- Enables easier testing and maintenance.

### 3.  Database Layer
- Manages reading and writing operations.
- The database can be replaced without affecting the upper layers.

>**Suggested database:** MongoDB, due to its performance with JSON documents and horizontal scalability.

## Architecture Diagram

Below is the layered representation of the microservice, showing the data flow between main components:

[ Client ] 
    ↓ HTTP Request
[ API Layer - FastAPI ]
    ↓ Validated Input
[ Service Layer ]
    ↓ Business Logic
[ Database Layer ]
    ↓
[ MongoDB / Other DB ]

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

- **FastAPI**: Enables rapid development of modern APIs with built-in validation, automatic documentation, and excellent performance.
- **Layered Architecture**: Encourages maintainability, testing, modularity, and decoupling of responsibilities.
- **MongoDB**: Ideal for handling JSON documents, highly scalable, and offers robust support for large volumes of data.
- **Docker + Kubernetes**: Provide standardized packaging, scalable deployment, and centralized management.

## Scalability & Best Practices

- **Horizontal Scaling**: The service can be easily replicated using Kubernetes (e.g., HPA).
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a well-defined role.
- **Strict Data Validation**: Prevents invalid data from affecting the system.
- **Future Monitoring**: Metrics and alerts are planned using Prometheus + Grafana.

> Architecture designed to support millions of requests with minimal performance degradation.
